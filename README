NAME
    Tcl::Tk extension module for Perl5

DESCRIPTION

The Tcl::Tk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5 Perl/Tk
extension) provides a raw but complete interface to the whole of Tk via the Tcl
extension.

Tcl::Tk is pure-perl, with all binary bindings offloaded to Tcl perl module.

Tcl::Tk has full support for perl/Tk syntax. This does not mean 100%
compatibility though. perl/Tk syntax is taken, but it is not followed when it
is not tcl/tk compatible. Do not expect full perl/tk compatibility, just use
the same syntax.

This approach allows you to intermix tcl/tk and perl/tk code, for example you
can use pure-tcl to create entire GUI and then use perl/Tk syntax to access
individual widgets. This also allows you to design GUI with any tcl/tk GUI
designer.

Build the module in the usual way for a perl extension:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In some rare cases you may want to pass some parameters to Makefile.PL.
You can see some explanations on these with

   perl Makefile.PL --help

is installed - to have acknowledged on this type of information.
