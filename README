NAME
    Tcl::Tk extension module for Perl5

DESCRIPTION
    
    The Tcl::Tk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
    Perl/Tk extension) provides a raw but complete interface to the whole
    of Tk via the Tcl extension.

    Have incomplete but quite much support for perlTk syntax (i.e. you can use
    perlTk syntax to use create Tcl/Tk GUI from perl), and existing Tcl/Tk GUI
    could be embedded to Perl without extra coding, including pure-Tcl widgets
    and any widgets that exist in you current Tcl/Tk.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In some rare cases you may want to pass some parameters to Makefile.PL, you
may see some explanations on them with

   perl Makefile.PL --help

is installed - to have acknowledged on this type of information.
